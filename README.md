# HARD FOAM

The game HARD FOAM is a card game like Hearthstone in PETSCII.

Cards are 5x6 characters with a 3x3 glyph, a number of energy to use and have attack and defense values.

Background is blue to accomodate the suit colors.

There are 4 "suits":
1. Goblin (black) - who doesn't like goblins?
1. Polystyrene (white) - the most widely used hard foam plastic in the world
1. Candy (red) - from "hard candy", the Madonna album
1. Soap (cyan) - for the "foam", soapSTONE is a soft kind of stone used for sculpting

There are 2 types of cards: monsters and spells.

There are 8 cards of each suit, with one of them legendary (yellow border).

To create a deck:
1. select a legendary
1. pick 4 of that color
1. pick 3 of the color black

If you choose the black legendary, your deck will automatically consist of all blacks.

The deck will consist of the 7 x 4 selected cards, with 1 randomly replaced by the legendary.

## GAME MECHANICS

* Summoning sickness: each card you play on the table has "summoning sickness" in that
you can only use it to attack the opponent on your next turn.

* Shielded: Card has a shield that absorbs all damage on first hit and then disappears.

* Ready: Card has no summoning sickness, i.e. it can attack immediately
